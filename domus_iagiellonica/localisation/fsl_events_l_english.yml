 louisiana.1.t:0 "Socialist Party Splits"
 louisiana.1.d:0 "In an attempt to gain mass appeal for Upton Sinclair's election campaign, the Socialist Party of Louisiana (SPCA) has rebranded itself as "End Poverty in Louisiana" (EPIC), causing hardline SPCA members to disavow the reforms and form a successor party. This mass exodus is a big blow to EPIC's support base, but Sinclair's rebranding is already drawing more supporters from the Louisiana Democrats than before.\n\nRumors indicate that the new SPCA's first meeting was nothing more than "a den of gambling and prostitution", with little discussion on party planning and political issues."
 louisiana.1.a:0 "So, they made their own party, with blackjack and hookers."

 louisiana_coup.1.d:0 "They struck suddenly and without warning.\n\nDue to recent rumors of a plot against him by Army officers, President [FSL.GetPres] had been surrounding himself and his official residence with loyal guards. However, they were no match for the coup's forces. [FSL.GetBrownshirtsVictory] [FSL.GetPres] has not been seen since, and it is unknown whether he and his staff managed to escape or were captured.\n\nIt seems that despite the coup's careful planning, the conspirators' plans on forming a new government were left uncertain. Instead of having a designated leader take hold of the country, power still remains in the hands of a military junta."
 FSL_brownshirts_victory:0 "Called upon by the rallying cry of the conspirators, "Mobilize!", hundreds of soldiers aided by just as many brownshirt paramilitaries stormed the capitol, presidential residence, and other government buildings in the middle of the night, fighting their way in and quickly overwhelming the police and federal guards."

 louisiana_coup.2.t:0 "Civil War Erupts"
 louisiana_coup.2.d:0 "Rogue Army forces attempted to take control of the capital and overthrow the government, but were expelled by guards loyal to President Merriam, with the help of the Saint-Louis police who arrived at the last minute. As the attempt failed and the rogue soldiers were being steadily pushed back, they began to disperse and retreat to both the northern and southern ends of the country.\n\nAs a last resort, the junta which orchestrated the attempt has proclaimed a rival government, plunging Louisiana into a civil war."
 louisiana_coup.2.a:0 "We will not fail!"
 louisiana_coup.3.t:0 "Louisianian Civil War Ends"
 louisiana_coup.3.d:0 "The civil war which has devastated Louisiana has come to an end. Anti-democratic troops[FSL.GetBrownshirtsWar] made their way back to Saint-Louis, this time managing to overrun the heavily entrenched garrison. They stormed the capitol, presidential residence, and other government buildings and cleared the surrounding neighborhoods of opposing forces before proclaiming victory. The deposed president has not been seen since, and it is unknown whether he and his staff managed to escape or were captured.\n\nThe ruling junta has not yet chosen a leader, ostensibly because they wish to focus on rebuilding the country first."

 louisiana_coup.4.t:0 "A new leader for Louisiana?"
 louisiana_coup.4.d:0 "With the nation mostly restabilized, the military junta has arguably fulfilled its purpose. The only matter left is to choose a suitable leader to guide our country into the future.\n\nThe main candidate is Joe Fergusson, known to members of the junta as "our Duke" and figurehead of the fascist Louisiana Identity party before the coup, renowned for his bold and charismatic leadership skills.\n\nAlternatively, the young and ambitious Paul de Vance, an outspoken proponent of falangism, is another viable candidate. Already relatively popular among the French population, who sometimes call him "Le Principal", before the coup, he likely aims to improve relations with our southern neighbors.\n\nEven so, the other option is to leave the junta in place as it is, for the forseeable future."
 louisiana_coup.4.a:0 "Joe Fergusson is the best leader for our continuing mission."
 louisiana_coup.4.b:0 "Ask Paul de Vance to form a new government."

 louisiana.3.t:0 "The Louisiana Purchase"
 louisiana.3.d:0 "The [FSL.GetAdjective] government has expressed interest in negotiating a purchase of Baja Louisiana, in an effort to reunite the two states. We are not necessarily being forced to negotiate under duress, but there was an implicit threat of annexation if [FSL.GetNameDef] does not get its way."
 louisiana.3.a:0 "Let them have it."
 louisiana.3.b:0 "Baja Louisiana belongs to [Root.GetNameDef]!"
 louisiana.4.t:0 "[FSL.GetName] offers protection"
 louisiana.4.d:0 "The [FSL.GetAdjective] government has transmitted a demand that we submit to their "protection"! They have said in no uncertain terms that if we do not submit, they will make us."
 louisiana.4.a:0 "If it will keep us alive..."
 louisiana.4.b:0 "I'd like to see them try!"

 louisiana.6.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects invitation"
 louisiana.6.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our invitation, and has expressed a desire to remain neutral. It is unlikely that we will be able to change their mind."
 louisiana.6.a:0 "How unfortunate, for the both of us."

 louisiana.9.a:0 "Excellent."
 louisiana.10.t:0 "Mexico rejects protection"
 louisiana.10.d:0 "The Mexican government has rejected our gracious offer of protection! And to add insult to injury, they taunt us by displaying military exercises on our border. We must respond at once!"
 louisiana.10.a:0 "You can't win them all."
 louisiana.10.b:0 "They will regret this show of defiance."
 louisiana.11.t:0 "Reagan elected President"
 louisiana.11.d:0 "The 1938 elections, between Republic Party candidate and famous actor Ronald Reagan, and Democrat candidate Alvin Kirsch, turned out to be quite suspenseful as millions of Louisianians sat by their radios as votes were being tallied. In the end, Reagan was elected president with a significant lead of nearly half a million votes, after campaigning on the slogan of "tearing down these walls" of division in our country."
 louisiana.11.a:0 "Congratulations, Mr. President."
 louisiana.12.t:0 "Kirsch elected President"
 louisiana.12.d:0 "The 1938 elections, between Republic Party candidate and famous actor Ronald Reagan, and Democrat candidate Alvin Kirsch, turned out to be quite suspenseful as millions of Louisianians sat by their radios as votes were being tallied. In the end, Kirsch was elected president with an extremely narrow lead of just over 9000 votes. Detractors had criticized the Democrats' chances of winning after President Merriam's decision not to run again, and for a while it seemed as if they had been right."
 louisiana.12.a:0 "Congratulations, Mr. President."
 louisiana.13.t:0 "Steve Shorter elected President"
 louisiana.13.d:0 "The 1942 elections turned out to be nowhere near as suspenseful as in 1938; as Ronald Reagan's refusal to run again resulted in the Republic Party having no viable candidate, the only competition was in the Democrat primary elections between incumbent President Alvin Kirsch and dark horse candidate Steve Shorter. Largely dissatisfied with the Kirsch administration, voters flocked to the previously unknown Shorter, securing his bid for the presidency."
